## Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10 or later
- Docker Compose v2.0 or later

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Strongly Recommended)

The docker-compose method is the preferred way to run DCS-SRS server as it provides:
- Automatic restart policies
- Proper volume mounting for logs and config
- Easy configuration management
- Better container lifecycle management

1. **Download the docker-compose.yml file**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayC-ADI/dcs-srs-server/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Start the service**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The service will start automatically using the default configuration. You can modify the environment variables directly in the docker-compose.yml file.

### Using Docker Run with .env file (Alternative)

If you prefer to use docker run with an .env file:

1. **Download the .env.example file**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayC-ADI/dcs-srs-server/main/.env.example -O .env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file to customize your server**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Run with docker run**
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name dcs-srs-server \
     -p 5002:5002/tcp \
     -p 5002:5002/udp \
     --env-file .env \
     jaycadi/dcs-srs-server:latest
   ```

**Note**: Port 5002 requires both TCP and UDP protocols for proper DCS-SRS communication.

## Configuration

The DCS-SRS server can be configured using environment variables. The easiest way is to modify the docker-compose.yml file directly, but you can also use a .env file if using docker run.

### Docker Compose Configuration (Recommended)

The included `docker-compose.yml` file provides a complete setup with all available configuration options:

```yaml

**Important Note about Configuration**: The server generates its configuration file (`cfg/server.cfg`) automatically on startup based on your environment variables using the entrypoint script. The configuration is created fresh each time the container starts, ensuring your environment variable changes are always applied.

**Volume Mounts**: Only the `Presets/` directory is mounted as a volume to allow easy management of server-side presets. All other configuration files (cfg/server.cfg, logs, client exports, etc.) are stored within the container and managed automatically.

To modify the configuration:

1. Stop the container: `docker-compose down`
2. Edit the environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file
3. Restart the container: `docker-compose up -d`

The entrypoint script will regenerate the configuration file with your updated settings on startup.

## Server Features

### Enhanced Server Management

Version 2.2.0.4 introduces several new server management features:

- **Improved IP Detection**: Automatic server IP detection for SRS connections
- **Simplified Chat Commands**: New shorter autoconnect chat command (just port needed)
- **Enhanced UI**: Consistent buttons and interface improvements across settings
- **Better Logging**: Fixed transmission logging with proper CSV format support
- **Server-Side Presets Fix**: Automatic command-line argument handling for server-side presets feature

### File Structure

The server automatically creates and manages all necessary files within the container:
- **cfg/server.cfg**: Generated automatically from environment variables on each startup
- **Presets/**: Mounted volume for server-side preset management (optional)
- **Logs and exports**: Stored within the container filesystem
- **banned.txt**: Managed internally by the server for IP banning

## REST API

The server now includes an optional REST API for remote management. Enable it by setting `HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED: "true"` in your configuration.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: The REST API provides administrative control over your server including the ability to kick and ban clients. Do NOT expose port 8080 to the public internet. Only expose this port on internal networks or use proper authentication/firewall rules. Exposing this API publicly could allow unauthorized users to take control of your server.

### API Security Best Practices

- **Internal Use Only**: Only bind the API to internal/private networks
- **Firewall Protection**: Use firewall rules to restrict API access to trusted IPs
- **VPN Access**: Consider requiring VPN access for API management
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep logs of API access and watch for unauthorized attempts

### Available Endpoints

#### Get Connected Clients
```http
GET /clients
```
Returns a list of all currently connected clients with their information.

#### Kick Client by GUID
```http
POST /client/kick/guid/{client_guid}
```
Disconnects a client using their unique GUID.

#### Kick Client by Name
```http
POST /client/kick/name/{client_name}
```
Disconnects a client using their display name.

#### Ban Client by GUID
```http
POST /client/ban/guid/{client_guid}
```
Bans a client by their GUID and adds their IP to the banned list.

#### Ban Client by Name
```http
POST /client/ban/name/{client_name}
```
Bans a client by their name and adds their IP to the banned list.

### API Usage Examples

```bash
# Get all connected clients
curl http://your-server:8080/clients

# Kick a client by name
curl -X POST http://your-server:8080/client/kick/name/PlayerName

# Ban a client by GUID
curl -X POST http://your-server:8080/client/ban/guid/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
```

## Channel Presets

Server-side channel presets allow you to provide predefined radio configurations to all clients. This feature is particularly useful for organized events or training scenarios.

**Important**: The SRS server requires the `--serverPresetChannelsEnabled=true` command-line argument to activate server-side presets, regardless of the configuration file setting. This Docker image automatically handles this requirement - when you set `SERVER_PRESETS_ENABLED: "true"`, the entrypoint script will automatically add the necessary command-line argument during server startup.

### Setting Up Presets

1. **Enable the Feature**
   ```yaml
   SERVER_PRESETS_ENABLED: "true"
   ```
   
   The entrypoint script will automatically add `--serverPresetChannelsEnabled=true` to the server startup command when this is enabled.

2. **Create Preset Files**
   Create `.txt` files in the mounted `Presets/` directory (default: `/docker/dcs-srs/Presets/` on the host).

3. **Preset File Format**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Training Frequencies",
     "channels": [
       {
         "name": "Tower",
         "frequency": 251.0,
         "modulation": "AM"
       },
       {
         "name": "Ground",
         "frequency": 249.5,
         "modulation": "FM"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Preset Naming

- Preset names ignore spaces, casing, and special characters for matching
- Files should be named descriptively (e.g., `training-presets.json`)
- Clients will see these presets in their SRS radio interface

### Managing Presets

To update presets:
1. Edit files in the host directory: `/docker/dcs-srs/Presets/`
2. Changes are automatically picked up by the server
3. No container restart required for preset changes

**Note**: If server-side presets aren't working, ensure `SERVER_PRESETS_ENABLED` is set to `"true"` (as a string) in your docker-compose.yml or .env file. The containerized solution automatically handles the required command-line argument that the SRS server needs to enable this feature.

## IP Banning

The server automatically manages banned IPs using a `banned.txt` file stored within the container. IPs can be banned using the REST API endpoints.

### Manual IP Management

Since the banned.txt file is stored within the container, manual IP management requires accessing the container:

```bash
# Access the container to view banned IPs
docker exec -it dcs-srs cat /app/banned.txt

# Remove a banned IP by recreating the container
# (This will clear all bans - use REST API for selective management)
docker-compose restart
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check if port 5002 is in use (both TCP and UDP)
   netstat -tulpn | grep :5002
   
   # Change port in .env file
   SRS_PORT=5004
   ```

2. **Container won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker-compose logs dcs-srs-server
   
   # Restart the service
   docker-compose restart
   ```

3. **DCS Client Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify both TCP and UDP ports are exposed
   docker port dcs-srs-server
   
   # Should show:
   # 5002/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:5002
   # 5002/udp -> 0.0.0.0:5002
   ```

### Monitoring

```bash
# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Monitor container resources
docker stats dcs-srs-server

# Check container health
docker-compose ps
```

### Network Requirements

- **Port 5002 TCP**: Required for client synchronization and server communication
- **Port 5002 UDP**: Required for voice data transmission  
- **Port 8080 TCP**: Required for REST API (if enabled) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT expose to internet**
- **Firewall**: Ensure both TCP and UDP traffic is allowed on port 5002
- **Important**: The server opens ONE PORT using both TCP AND UDP protocols - both must be forwarded

### Server Hosting Notes

For server hosting:
- **Always open both TCP AND UDP on port 5002** (or your configured port)
- **REST API Security**: If using the REST API, only expose port 8080 to trusted networks
- Use manual port forwarding - UPnP may not work reliably for both protocols
- If clients can connect but can't use PTT (Push-to-Talk), check UDP port forwarding
- The VoIP Green Plug indicator shows if voice communication is working properly

### DCS Integration

### Client Setup

1. **Install DCS-SRS Client**: Download from the official DCS-SRS repository
2. **Configure Connection**: 
   - Server IP: Your server's IP address
   - Port: 5002 (or your configured port)
   - Password: If you set one in your .env file
3. **Test Connection**: Join your server and test voice communication

### Server Information for Clients

Share these details with your pilots:
- **Server Address**: `your-server-ip:5002`
- **Password**: (if configured)
- **Server Name**: (as set in SRS_SERVER_NAME)
