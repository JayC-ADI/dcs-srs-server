# DCS-SRS Server Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and modify the values as needed
#
# STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Use docker-compose.yml instead of this .env file
# The docker-compose.yml method provides better configuration management,
# automatic restart policies, and proper volume mounting.
