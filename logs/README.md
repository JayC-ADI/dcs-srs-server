DCS-SRS Logs Folder
====================

This directory contains log files generated by the DCS-SRS voice server.

Files may include:
- Transmission logs (if TRANSMISSION_LOG_ENABLED=true)
- Debug and runtime logs
- CSV logs of all radio transmissions

These logs are automatically rotated and deleted after a number of days as specified by TRANSMISSION_LOG_RETENTION in the config.

You do not need to manually create any files here â€” they will be generated by the server at runtime.

Note: Logging is disabled by default.
